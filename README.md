Below is a brief explanation on how to use the trackr application

# Types of Habits

Numerical Habits - tracked by inputting a numerical value that is compared to a goal value
Positive habits are habits that must meet or exceed the goal value
Negative habits are habits that must be at or below the goal value
Binary habits are habits that are either completed or not completed, with no intermediate form

# Daily Dashboard

Daily Dashboard displays a list of all habits with their goals, todays value, and streak
The habit has a +/- indicator to indicate if it is a positive or negative habit
Numerical habits are tracked using a numeric up-down
Binary habits are tracked with check marks
Streaks indicate the number of consecutive days that a user has completed a habit
The sync menu button is used to load current progress into the database
There are three buttons that open forms corresponding to creating, editing, and displaying metrics

# Creating a Habit
Must click the create habit button
Options to enter a habit name, habit type
If the type is numerical, the user must indicate positive or negative and must enter a threshold value
A message box will pop up as confirmation that the habit has been successfully added or will display an error message

# Editing Habit
Must click the edit habit button
User can view a list of all habits that are tracked and untracked
User can change the name of a habit or change the threshold of a numerical habit
User cannot change from binary to numerical or positive to negative
User can choose the delete option to permanently delete habit from database
User can check/uncheck the continue tracking checkbox to decide if thet want to remove a habit from the daily dashboard without removing it entirely from the database

#Displaying metrics

User can see the habit name, percent completion since the start date, longest streak, and a graph button
If the user presses the graph button they can view a pie chart for binary habits or a line graph for numerical habits over time
The line graph displays the actual progress along with the goal.
